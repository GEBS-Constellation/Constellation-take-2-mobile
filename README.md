# Constellation Take 2(D) - Mobile

The mobile client of the game. There is also a server/main game part at another repo.

- Install unity 2022.3.45f1 (Include android SDK and stuff)
- ...

## Connection
The server and any connected client must be connected to the same LAN network. Each client can connect to the server by entering the IP address of the server, or by clicking on the server if UDP broadcasting is working properly. Make sure to allow the game through the firewall when it prompts you to do so, depending on which network profile you use!

If the connection still does not work or if none of you are connected to a common network, a mobile hotspot can be created on the server and every client must first connect to the hotspot. It is then possible to connect to the server using its IP (such as 192.168.137.1 on Windows).
